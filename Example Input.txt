Kausar: What a day.
// Translator’s note: “What a day” is a way to express that events throughout the day have been remarkable or unusual, in a good way or a bad way
Han: Yeah, right.
// Note: “Yeah, right.” is sarcastic. Han is poking fun at Kausar, implying in a friendly, joking manner that Kausar is overreacting to whatever events prompted them to say “What a day.”

Saule: So, what’s up today?
:Suddenly, a loud crash is heard!
Kausar: What?
